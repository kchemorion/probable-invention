# AI Agent CLI

**AI Agent CLI** is a Python-based autonomous agent that takes control of your system upon initialization. With minimal human interaction, this agent uses your provided API keys to explore, create, and manage open-source projects independently. Designed to innovate and contribute to the open-source community, the agent operates autonomously, deciding its next steps based on trends, data, and opportunities.

---

## Features
- **Autonomous Operation**: Once initialized, the agent independently explores, implements, and shares open-source projects.
- **Secure API Integration**: Safely stores and utilizes API keys for accessing external services.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Automatically creates and pushes projects to GitHub, complete with documentation and examples.
- **Dynamic Exploration**: Identifies trends, gaps, and innovative ideas across various fields and acts on them.

## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Initialize the Agent
Run the following command to start the agent:

```bash
ai-agent-cli
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys
On the first run, the agent will prompt you to input your API key. Ensure you have access to APIs for services you want the agent to utilize (e.g., GitHub, trending topics, or data scraping platforms).  

Example:

```plaintext
No API key found. Please enter your API key:
API Key: [Enter your key here]
```

The API key will be securely stored in your configuration file (`~/.ai_agent_cli_config.json`).

### Step 3: Autonomous Workflow
Once initialized, the agent will:
1. Connect to relevant APIs.
2. Explore trending topics and identify potential project opportunities.
3. Create, implement, and push projects to GitHub.
4. Continuously evolve based on discoveries and trends.

---

## Configuration

The agent stores configuration in a JSON file located at:
```plaintext
~/.ai_agent_cli_config.json
```

You can manually edit this file if needed to update the API key or other settings.

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

---

## Roadmap

Planned features include:
- **Expanded API Integrations**: Support for more APIs, including data science platforms, research repositories, and developer toolchains.
- **Task Customization**: Allow users to input preferences for project types or fields of interest.
- **Machine Learning Enhancements**: Use AI to improve project selection and execution over time.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Detailed logs to track progress and provide summaries of completed tasks.
